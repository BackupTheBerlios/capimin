<header>Editing the fax send queue</header>
<p>You can modify your outgoing fax by directly changing the values in the form.<br>
To commit this changes, select the fax by clicking in the checkboxes (left on the list)<br>
and then press button &quot;change&quot;.</p>
<p><b>More Options:</b></p>
<p><i>Select all</i> and <i>Invert selection</i><br>
JavaScript helper functions to select all faxes or invert your current selection<br>
(JavaScript must be enabled in your browser to use it)</p>
<p><i>Change</i><br>
changes the selected faxes.<br>
Note: If you don't have any faxes selected (with the checkboxes) but you have edited<br>
some data, nothing will change.</p>
<p><i>Change &amp; Send</i><br>
Applies the changes made to the selected faxes and sends them immediately (changes the start time<br>
to the current time, so that capisuite will send the faxes, when it checks the queue)</p>
<p><i>1h later</i><br>
Add one hour to the start time for the selected faxes.<br>
<b>Note:</b> This function doesn't work correct (at least with Python 2.2.1/SuSE 8.1)<br>
When changing the time for a fax which is in another daylight saving time (DST) than the current day,<br>
then this function adds/subtracts also the DST changes<br>
No Problems with SuSE 9.0 and Python 2.3/ Win32 and Python 2.3</p>
<p><i>Delete</i><br>
removes the selected files from the send queue</p>
